#### Entity Framework Core
EF Core is a modern object-database mapper for .NET. It supports LINQ queries, change tracking, updates, and schema migrations.
EF Core works with SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, SQLite, Azure Cosmos DB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and other databases through a provider plugin API.
EF Core can serve as an object-relational mapper (O/RM), which:
- Enables .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects.
- Eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that typically needs to be written.
(EF Core 可用作对象关系映射程序 (O/RM)，这可以实现以下两点：
- 使 .NET 开发人员能够使用 .NET 对象处理数据库。
- 无需再像通常那样编写大部分数据访问代码。)

#### Serilog
Simple .NET logging with fully-structured events
Flexible, structured events — log file convenience.
Serilog is a diagnostic logging library for .NET applications. It is easy to set up, has a clean API, and runs on all recent .NET platforms. While it's useful even in the simplest applications, Serilog's support for structured logging shines when instrumenting complex, distributed, and asynchronous applications and systems.
Like many other libraries for .NET, Serilog provides diagnostic logging to files, the console, and many other outputs.
